# The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Coding-Projects

These are a few examples of functionality I developed for The Tech Academy's Learning Module System (LMS). While developing the LMS with the 
live project team, my tasks ranged from simple bug fixes and styling errors to more in depth back-end work. All code written for the LMS was done so
following an MVC design pattern.
